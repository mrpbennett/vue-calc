# vue-calc

I wanted to give myself a chance to learn [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) as I started to get a little frustrated with React. So went on the hunt for a calcuator tutorial and produced this. The way vue handles methods and data is super easy and stress free.

I am going to be using Vue ALOT MORE.

## Todo:

-   [ ] Make the current calcation display above the output
-   [ ] Find some sexy icons for the operator keys

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```
